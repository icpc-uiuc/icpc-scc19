The United Institute for Underground Construction(UIUC) is a famous company that is dedicated to constructing the best underground(subway) system. But how good can an underground system be without vending machines at the stations? As an insightful employee, \pittoresque decided to offer a plan of building some vending machines at some stations. But there are some details to consider:
\begin{itemize}
    \item As the stations are crowded, there is only enough space to build one machine at each station.
    \item The supply for all vending machines comes from a single manufacturing factory, which is a constant number every day. And the total amount of drinks bought each day should not exceed this number,
    \item For each station, a fixed amount of people will buy drinks at a certain price everyday, given that there is a vending machine there.
    \item There isn't many people taking underground, so the total number of people that buy drinks is small.
\end{itemize}

To be specific, there are $n$ stations numbered from $1$ to $n$. At the $i$th station, you can place a vending machine such that exactly $p_i$ people come and buy drinks, and each drink will provide a revenue of $v_i$. Given that total number of people that buy drinks across all the stations is $P \leq 200000$, and the total amount of drinks is $W$.

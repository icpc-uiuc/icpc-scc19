\TiChuot loves travelling. In fact, it's his $4^{th}$ most favourite hobby. This time, \TiChuot decides to visit the Country of Larger-Smaller (or
LS for short). LS consists of $n$ cities numbered from $1$ to $n$. Interestingly, city $i$ is assigned a distinct value $a_i$. Moreover, these cities
are of $2$ types:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item
        A city $i$ of this type can only travel to another city $j$ if $a_i < a_j$.
        \item
        A city $i$ of this type can only travel to another city $j$ if $a_i > a_j$.
    \end{enumerate}
Since each city in LS has its own culture and is very interesting to see, \TiChuot wants to visits all the cities, each exactly once. His trip will
start from city $1$ and will end at city $n$. As a competitive programmer, \TiChuot always practices, even while travelling. This time, he wants to
count the number of ways he can schedule his trip given the information above. Can you help him?\\

Since the answer can be large, you only need to output its remainder when divided by $10^9 + 7$.

\InputFile
The first line contains an integer $n$ $(2 \leq n \leq 5000)$, the number of cities. The second line contains $n$ distinct integers, $a_1, a_2, ...,
a_n$, denoting the values assigned to these cities $(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9)$. The third line, contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$ where
$b_i$ denotes the type of the $i^{th}$ city $(1 \leq b_i \leq 2)$.

\OutputFile

Output on $1$ line an integer which is the desired value modulo $10^9 + 7$.

{stdin}{stdout}
{2 second}{}{}

``Triangoes'', a new type of fruit, are in triangular shapes and taste like mangoes. However, nobody in the world has ever seen ``triangoes'' since they always grow implicitly on the tree and hide in the triangles. Formally, a ``triango'' tree is an undirected weighted tree and a ``triango'' is a set of three vertices on the ``triango'' tree such that the lengths of the three paths between each pair of these three vertices satisfy the triangle inequality $a + b > c$; that is to say, they form a triangle. 

After a long expedition, \Suzukaze has eventually found a ``triango'' tree in his house. He needs your help to count the number of ``triangoes'' on the ``triango'' tree. Can you help him? 

\InputFile

The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 5 \times 10^4$), the number of vertices on the ``triango'' tree. The vertices on the ``triango'' tree are labeled from 1 to $n$.

In the following $n-1$ lines, each of the lines contains 3 integers $u, v, w$ ($1 \le u,v \le n; u \neq v;1 \le w \le 10^5$), which means that there is a weighted edge whose weight is $w$ connecting vertex $u$ and vertex $v$. 

It's guaranteed that the input data is a tree.

\OutputFile

Output an integer - the number of ``triangoes'' on the ``triango'' tree.

\begin{problem}{Greenberg Mass Comparison}

{1 second}{256 MB}{}

Linguist Joseph Greenberg proposed the method of mass comparison for determining genetic relatedness between languages. In this method, $N$ languages are categorized into one or more families. Formally, given a set of $N$ different languages $\mathcal{L} = \{L_1, \hdots, L_N\}$, a relation analysis is a set of families $\mathcal{F}$, satisfying the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathcal{F} = \{F_1, \hdots, F_k\}$ for some $k$
\item For $1 \le i \le k$, $F_i \subset \mathcal{L}$ and $F_i \ne \varnothing$
\item For $1 \le i,j \le k, i \ne j$, $F_i \cap F_j = \varnothing$
\item $\cup_{1 \le i \le k}{F_i} = \mathcal{L}$
\end{itemize}

Greenberg wants to know how many distinct relation analysis are there for $N$ languages. Two relation analyses $\mathcal{F}_1$ and $\mathcal{F}_2$ are distinct if $\mathcal{F}_1 \ne \mathcal{F}_2$. Can you help him compute this number?

\InputFile

The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 100$), the number of test cases.
In the following $T$ lines, each line contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 100$).

\OutputFile

For each test case, output a line containing the answer for the queried $N$, modulo $(10^9+7)$.

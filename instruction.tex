\centerline{\textbf{\huge Contest Instruction}}

\section*{\raggedright \underline{\LARGE Rules}}
\par\large
You can only use one EWS computer and no any electronic devices are allowed. Other rules are stated below.

\section*{\raggedright \underline{\LARGE Scoring}}
\par\large
Teams are ranked by the number of problems solved, with teams solving the same number of problems ranked by least total time. The total time is the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved.  The time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submission of the first accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes for every previously rejected run for that problem.  There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved. Teams solving the same number of problems with the same total time are ranked by the smallest elapsed time of their last accepted solution (not counting penalties for rejected runs).

\section*{\raggedright \underline{\LARGE Disqualification}}
\par\large
Any team that jeopardizes the integrity of the contest or violates the rules of the contest will be disqualified. Some examples of such actions are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item accessing the Internet in any way,
    \item disrupting power to computers,
    \item corrupting judging materials or the judging process,
    \item collaborating with anyone not on the team (this includes using a portable phone),
    \item disobeying site officialsâ€™ instructions regarding appropriate conduct.
\end{itemize}
